##Installation##
Simply drag and drop the "administrationstick" folder into your addons.  
Administrators are automatically given the admin stick.  
The name of the administration stick weapon is "admin_stick".  
Administrators can also give themselves the administration stick if they somehow loose it. The command is "give_adminstick".  

If you want to use ULX admin mod with this script, you need to configurate the ULX ranks who recieves the admin stick.  
You can do this inside adminstick_config.lua.  

##Adding Tools##
You can add your own tools inside the admin_stick/shared.lua. They are ordered the way they are added in the file.  
This obviously requires lua knowledge to do so, and I advise that you don't modify that file if you don't know what you are doing!  

##Errors & Support##
If you find any problems with the script, please create a support ticket through the site! It is important that you include a description of the problem and all errors.  
Additionally, I rarely give additional support for my scripts. If there is a general error with the script, that is fine, refer to the text above.  
I am also not interested in modifying you a custom version of the addon. Also not upon payment. Sorry!  

Conflicting addons is not to be said if I will support that or not. This is something I will decide upon confrontation about a conflicting addon. If you have some sort of proof that an addon is conflicting with my addon, please create a ticket with the details you might have.  

Thank you!
